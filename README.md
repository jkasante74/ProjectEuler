What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a collection of math problems that people solve for fun. For each problem, we give a description and an answer to the requirement of the project. Currently, there are 50 of the 600 projects solved.


The list of problems is ever-growing as Project Euler is always adding new problems

When adding your solution here, make sure it's a method of finding the solution and not the solution itself

You can submit your solutions to previously solved problems, but don't ignore the unsolved ones :)

Visit https://projecteuler.net/recent for an overview of which problems have been recently added.

You can also review our method and comment appropriately whenever possible. However, you must contact should you like to download any of the solutions.
